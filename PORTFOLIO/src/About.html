        <p>"I build applications with logic and write poetry with emotions."</p>
        I am Vandesh Ghodke a Full Stack Developer with skills in HTML, CSS, Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap. My focus is on building scalable, user-friendly applications. I truly enjoy simplifying complex problems and providing elegant solutions that will be there forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the internship in the Army Workshop 512 (ASA Core Mechanical Training), I was trained in a disciplined environment that was very high pressure where expectation for utmost accuracy, resilience, and critical thinking was paramount. This experience has shaped the mindset into the delivery of focus, confidence, and under pressure capability which are all traits I bring to any undertaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside coding, I speak and write another language full of poetical expressions and shayaris with which I conjure creativity and emotion into words. With technical skills, disciplined training, and creative expression, I render solutions that distinguish and mark their memories onto machines and into the minds of people.
